## Background and Terminologies

### What is touch typing?

Touch typing, as described in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), refers to "a style of typing without looking". Touch typist usually types accurately relying on muscle memory which doesn't involve looking at keyboard layout. It's commonly believed that touch typing entails dramatically higher accuracy and typing speed. Therefore it's deemed a well-worth skill to practice on.

### Typing practice websites

There are already plenty of websites out there providing user with detailed and well-crafted lessons to practice typing, hoping to help them gain higher speed and accuracy in the end. Some of the websites even make money from VIP supply of advanced practice curricula. Though, many of these practice websites share some common patterns or defects:

- Practice is modularized into lessons. Users are able to proceed step by step. This "divide and conquer" strategy helps to reduce boredom and reserve passion.
- Text for practice is usually fixed. It's not uncommon to find the first practice lesson of some websites involving repeatedly typing sequence of letters `j` and `k`. Not only does such practice manner yields boredom and potential finger tiresome, but also lacks motive for personalized practice tailor-made for individual user.
- Dominated by QWERTY layout.
- Usually focus on English language corpus.
