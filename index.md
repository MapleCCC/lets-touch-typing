# Let's Practice Touch Typing (in a smart way)

TL;DR: brief intro to KeyBr.com - a well-famed typing practice website

## Background and Terminologies

### What is touch typing?

Touch typing, as described in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), refers to "a style of typing without looking". Touch typist usually types accurately relying on muscle memory which doesn't involve looking at keyboard layout. It's commonly believed that touch typing entails dramatically higher accuracy and typing speed. Therefore it's deemed a well-worth skill to practice on.

### Typing practice websites

There are already plenty of websites out there providing user with detailed and well-crafted lessons to practice typing, hoping to help them gain higher speed and accuracy in the end. Some of the websites even make money from VIP supply of advanced practice curricula. Though, many of these practice websites share some common patterns or defects:

- Practice is modularized into lessons. Users are able to proceed step by step. This "divide and conquer" strategy helps to reduce boredom and reserve passion.
- Text for practice is usually fixed. It's not uncommon to find the first practice lesson of some websites involving repeatedly typing sequence of letters `j` and `k`. Not only does such practice manner yields boredom and potential finger tiresome, but also lacks motive for personalized practice tailor-made for individual user.
- Dominated by QWERTY layout.
- Usually focus on English language corpus.

### Terminologies

- WPM. Word-per-minute. A ubiquitous measure unit of typing speed.
- CPM. Character-per-minute. Another less popular measure unit.
- `QWERTY`. It refers to the ubiquitous keyboard layout world-widely used nowadays. Specified by the six letters on the top right of the keyboard layout.
- `Dvorak`. The allegedly second most popular English keyboard layout.
- `Colemak`. The allegedly third most popular English keyboard layout. It's variant `Colemak Mod DH` enjoys popularity.
- Touch typing. Typing without looking at the keyboard.
- Touch typist. People who touch type.
- Stenography. A style of typing that hit multiple keys with more than one fingers simultaneously. It's much difficult to learn than touch typing but can achieve significantly higher typing speed that outclasses normal one-key-per-time typing.
