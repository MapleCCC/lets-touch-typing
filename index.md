It's commonly believed that touch typing entails dramatically higher accuracy and typing speed. Therefore it's deemed a well-worth skill to practice on.

Some of the websites even make money from VIP supply of advanced practice curricula. Though, many of these practice websites share some common patterns or defects:

- Text for practice is usually fixed. It's not uncommon to find the first practice lesson of some websites involving repeatedly typing sequence of letters `j` and `k`.

- QWERTY layout is ubiquitous.

### Terminologies

- WPM. Word-per-minute. A nearly standard measure unit of typing speed.
